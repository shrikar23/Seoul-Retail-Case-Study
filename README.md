# Seoul-Retail-Case-Study
Created a predictive model to determine the different factors that affect the total profits for each store.

A Company has five franchise stores (A through E) located in an exclusive shopping district in Seoul, South Korea. 
Each store sells the same brands and items. As per guesstimates, roughly 95% of their sales come from Japanese tourists. 
Even though the stores bear the name of the same company, they are effectively competitors due to their close proximity to each 
other. 

The franchisee of Store B, Mr. Choe, is interested in identifying the factors that affect sales in his store and the extent to 
which these factors affect sales. He is also interested in identifying the similarities and dissimilarities of these impact factors across the five stores.

The final Output was:

1. A linear regression model for each store to identify factors that affect the sales.

2. A comparison of these factors to determine how they vary across the 5 stores.

The dataset consisted of aggregated sales data on all five stores from September 1 2011 to March 16 2013.
